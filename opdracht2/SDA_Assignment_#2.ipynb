    "# Introduction\n",
    "In the previous assignment you have performed some statistical hypothesis testing by assuming that the data follows a normal distribution. Assuming a model (distribution) is called a ‘parametric’ approach. Although the normal distribution is quite a common distribution, other and very different distributions also occur in real data. What’s more, sometimes it is desirable to do so-called ‘non-parametric’ inference where no particular model is assumed from which the data (or statistics) would be sampled from.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will:\n",
    "1. Generate data samples from different distributions;\n",
    "2. Study the p-value and its relation to confidence intervals;\n",
    "3. Calculate confidence intervals using a resampling technique;\n",
    "4. Study the appropriateness of resampling for different sample sizes;\n",
    "5. Compare the confidence interval with the known truth from the generating models;\n",
    "6. Determine if two data samples come from the same distribution using a permutation test.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding and References\n",
    "You should use the Python programming language for all programming tasks. You should use native Python code for all tasks unless otherwise instructed. Whenever you have already implemented a particular function before by yourself, from that point onward you are allowed to use the more efficient implementation from a package. So for instance, if you have already implemented yourself the `mean()` function and have used it at least once in an answer then you are allowed to use the `np.mean()` function from numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exceptions are:\n",
    "1. the logarithm function, which you may find in the packages `math` or `numpy`.\n",
    "2. the square root function √x, which can be computed using `x**0.5`.\n",
    "Further Exception (only week 4): the use of vectors and matrices (`numpy.array`) is additionally allowed in week 4's assignment. (Essentially I assume that you know how to implement multidimensional arrays by nesting lists, so no need to show that explicitly.) Still, before you use the `np.dot` function from numpy, for instance, implement it yourself first to show that you know what it does exactly. Also for clustering, such as k-means clustering: implement it yourself first and use it at least once to show that it works. If needed for performance reasons you can subsequently use the implementation from the `sklearn` package, for example.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For some questions you may have to look up certain facts, formulas, equations, or freshen up your knowledge. The problems in the assignments do not always refer to pertinent sources; you are expected to research into missing knowledge yourself. \n",
    "For refreshers of the very basics of probability theory, or additional resources behind statistical concepts introduced here, please look on Canvas for the resources provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please do not ever copy (parts of) your answer or code from any other source, be it online or from fellow students. You can help each other understand the problem and to compare outcomes, but not copy answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submission\n",
    "Please upload your answers to all questions in Jupyter Notebook format (.ipynb extension) through the appropriate Canvas page no later than Sunday, November 10th, 2024 at 23:59. Your answers and derivations should be included inline in your Jupyter Notebook file (do not remove any output before saving the file). Be sure to make every step explicit and clearly identifiable (computational performance or code brevity are not graded). Submissions by e-mail or past this deadline will not be considered.\n",
    "Deadline extension requests will not be considered unless they are mediated through a study advisor.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "You can earn a maximum of 140 points. In case you do not submit both your answers and code by the deadline then you receive an “NA”. If you submit your answers and code but score 0 points then your grade will be a 1 (Dutch grading system). Scoring all 140 points means your grade becomes a 10. An amount of bonus points can be earned which is added to your score to a maximum of 140. That is, each week you can earn a maximum grade of 10 and it is not possible to transfer (bonus) points from one assignment to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the weekly assignments will have a relative weight proportional to the maximum number of points. In total they make up 50% of your final grade."

That is, we do have access to the ‘generating model’ (your RNG) and can obtain experimental values from it, but we do not know how\n",

Compute the 0.75-percentile for each sample (giving you thus at least $10^4$ percentile values) and then compute the empirical 95% confidence interval of this statistic (two-sided) based on these $10^4$ computed percentiles. Show a histogram of the 0.75-percentile values and indicate also the confidence interval you just computed.\n",
